It's used for a variety of needs, from autonomous application management, to uses like NFV orchestration. It was built from the bottom up as a cloud orchestration framework, and is built to be pluggable to any infrastructure. Its also the most extensive implementation of TOSCA, which makes it completely technology agnostic.",
