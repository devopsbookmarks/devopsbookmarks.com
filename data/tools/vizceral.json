    "description": "Netflix Vizceral is a component for displaying traffic data on a webgl canvas. If a graph of nodes and edges with data about traffic volume is provided, it will render a traffic graph animating the connection volume between nodes. This component can take multiple traffic graphs and will generate a 'global' graph showing all incoming traffic into each of the 'regions', with support for cross-region traffic. There are three levels of information, global, regional, and service-level, with clicking or double-clicking on a node bringing you one level deeper.",
