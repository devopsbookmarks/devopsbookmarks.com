    "description": "The Assimilation Suite discovers systems, services, network connections, configuration and dependencies, IP and MAC addresses. This all goes into a continually updated graph-based configuration management database (CMDB).  This is then compared and scored against best practices, services and servers are monitored - all with near-zero configuration - in a way that scales to hundreds of thousands of servers.\nIt also provides visualization tools, APIs for sending alerts to humans and other systems, and a variety of canned reports (queries) to aid in securing and managing systems, hooking into ChatOps, and creating plans for triaging your security issues",
